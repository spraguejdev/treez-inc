I attached an image of one of our screens. Just looking for you to reproduce the table section of the screenshot.
No need to do the top part. Just the column headers and rows. And can you try to implement it using react-virtualized?

Feel free to infer anything you want and and make up any assumptions on behavior.
For example, u'll see that some package labels are read-only. Just randomize or make it all read-only.
I'm primarily mainly looking at look and feel, code readability, and 3rd party library usage.

## ToDo 7/4

> > Initialize a single row component for the table with column headers and so forth: Make sure to have dynamic column widths
> > Style the row to match picture!
> > Find out how to make sections variable with an text input.

## Questions to ask Dewey

> > What is the functionality for the Assign Column of the UI?
> > What is the functionality for the checkBoxes?
> > Would you like me to set up a database for data persistance and a GET request to fetch dummyData from it and a POST request to add data to it? If so, what database would you like me to use? Should I add a button to post data or another type of event?
> > Would you like me to use redux? This simple component is not a good use case to do so, but if you would like me to, that's fine.

Render the rows in the ProductTable component
