I attached an image of one of our screens. Just looking for you to reproduce the table section of the screenshot.
No need to do the top part. Just the column headers and rows. And can you try to implement it using react-virtualized?

Feel free to infer anything you want and and make up any assumptions on behavior.
For example, u'll see that some package labels are read-only. Just randomize or make it all read-only.
I'm primarily mainly looking at look and feel, code readability, and 3rd party library usage.
